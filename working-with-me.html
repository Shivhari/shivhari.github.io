    <ul>
      <li>You reading this note means that we might work together.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 class="mt-4" style="color: white;"><i>Operating principals</i></h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Work together = anything that is just not casual hanging out. 
        <br>Includes: ideas, feedback, projects together, startup ideas, music, even working on personal issues and general life stuff.
      </li> 
      <li>
        I care about my "Say/Do ratio".  Say (or commit) less + Do what you say.
      </li>
      <li>
        I prefer async communication. I prefer text or voice notes to in-person meetings or video calls. 
        <br>
        When talking about text, I prefer non-WhatsApp based text communication. WhatsApp is good for very transactional things like "how you doing" or "what's the status update". 
        <br>Anything that is more structured and requires back and forth discussion - preference is to put it on notion and share. It can be a space where we and decide and discuss.
      </li>
      <li>
        I tend to prefer black and white putting down of things whether that be meeting summaries, to-dos, next steps, mind maps etc.
      </li>
      <li>I like to take into account context that has been previously shared. Which is why I rely on written communication to quickly refresh, gather and maintain context. I also tried to be as structured and methodical about my approaches as possible. For it works remarkably well for me.
      </li>
      <li>
        I sometimes am lacking in the ability to have  consistency / rigor of execution. It is something that I've worked on and improved. I will always try to stick by my commitments. There might be times when I don't, and the fault of that obviously lies with me. I shall be honest about this.
      </li>
      <!--emo-->
      <h5 class="mt-4" style="color: white;"><i>Interpersonal stuff</i></h5>
      <li>
        I would appreciate transparency and honest communication always. I will always try to be accepting and non-defensive towards any conversation.
      </li> 
      <li>
        My preference is to not be in a place where I have to guess what is on the other person's mind.</li>

      <li>I really appreciate honest feedback. I would like you to be upfront tell me if something is good or bad. We can have a discussion around why it was so. I want to be objectively as close to the truth as possible. And for that I need to hear objectivity. 
        <br>
        Which is also a two way street - if something is good, I would love it if you can throw in a sentence or two of how you appreciate or like something. </li>
        <li>I am at a stage of my life where I cannot hold unresolved threads of relationships with people. We might choose to agree to disagree we might choose to not interact with each other but that is a better place to be than to leave things open ended and hanging because that causes anxiety and unnecessary amount of mindspace to be taken up.</li>
        <h5 style="color: white;"><i>Others</i></h5>
      <li>
        I, in perpetuity, sincerely apologize if any of my actions, feelings, thoughts, cause hurt or is felt as condescension or making you feel lesser. I generally mean no harm.
      </li>
      <li>
        I tend to philosophize, spiritualize almost everything that I work on. I know no other framework through which I can operate as well as these. And it is not a prerequisite or necessity that you have to engage with me on either of these two levels. 
      </li>
      <li>I try to approach everything from a place of love and compassion. <br> ~ Shiv.</li>
      <!--<h4 style="color: white;"><i>Longer version</i></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>So we might have been friends or acquaintances or strangers and we have for some shape or form started to work together.</li>
    
       <li>What I mean by work together is anything that is just not casual hanging out. So work together your includes ideas, feedback, working on projects together startup ideas together, working on music DJ sets together, could even sometimes be working on personal issues and life stuff and all of that.</li> 
      <li>
        My preference for when I'm working with somebody is one, I cannot be at a place where I have to guess what is on the other person's mind. So I would appreciate transparency and honest communication always. It's good to have difficult conversations because that shows that we are progressing ahead and voicing our concerns. I will try to be always accepting and non defensive towards any of these difficult conversations. As long as it is pre faced with the tag of this being something that is a difficult conversation to have.
      </li>
      <li>
        I from my side, trying to be as honest as I can be, I really care about my say do ratio, which is say less, do what you say. And to me that is really important.
      </li>
      <li>
        I am not a perfect human being and I have many flaws, one of which is my inability to follow up or have solid consistency and rigor of execution. It is something that I've been working on and have improved, but it would be delusional to think that I'm perfectly capable of executing 100% of the time. So I will always try to commit to things and stick by them. But it also means that there might be times when I don't, and there is absolutely no excuse for that and the fault that obviously lies with me. I tend to also be very honest and transparent with what I do.
      </li>
      <li>
        I prefer async communication to sync communication I prefer text or voice notes to in person meetings or video calls. When talking about text, I prefer non WhatsApp based text communication. As long as WhatsApp is good for very transactional things like hey, how you doing or what's the status update, but anything that is a little more structured and requests back and forth discussion my default is to put it on notion and share it with whoever is required and it can be a space where we collaborate, add comments, write your own thing and so on and so forth.
      </li>
      <li>
        I tend to prefer black and white putting down of things whether that be mind maps, text, images or (esp) meeting summaries.
      </li>
      <li>I try to approach everything from a place of love and compassion, and I hope that all the work that I put in sort of reflects that fundamental nature of being loving and compassionate towards all sentient and non sentient objects.</li>
      <li>Very importantly, I really appreciate honest feedback. If you think something is not good (or even very good) I would like you to be upfront and tell me about it. I do not like sugarcoating / convenient conversations for the sake of it. We can have a discussion around why it was so. I do not want a situation where I have a group of people who echo chamber everything I do and agree to everything that I'm doing just because they are my friends or they don't want to hurt my feelings. I want to be objectively as close to the truth as possible. And for that you need to hear objectivity. So which is also a two way street - if something is good, I would love it if you can go out of your way and throw in a sentence or two of how you appreciate or like something. If I have rubbed you the wrong way if have left left a bad taste in your mouth, then I would love it if you could tell me that upfront. Because that just makes for a cleaner, nicer conversation. I am at a stage of my life where I cannot hold unresolved threads of relationships with people. We might choose to agree to disagree we might choose to not interact with each other but that is a better place to be than to leave things open ended and hanging because that causes anxiety and unnecessary amount of mindspace to be taken up.
      </li>
      <li>My preference is to take into account context that has been previously given because sometimes otherwise it can be quite frustrating to have to recontextualize something or re contextualize the conversation all over again. Which is also why there is a preference to written communication so that context can be quickly gathered and maintained. Again. I'm someone who generally takes extensive notes or things put things down in black and white and that's just the nature of how they operate. I also tried to be as structured and methodical about my approaches as possible. For some people that might seem a bit too much, but it works remarkably well for me. I have ADHD so I have over time picked up systems that work really well for me I'd have gotten good output in terms of me getting stuff done. 

      </li>
      <li>
        Also, I in future perplexity already apologize if any of my actions feelings, thoughts, hurt or if it is seen as condescension or hurtfulness or making you feel lesser than I sincerely apologize that is almost never my intention. It's just to get to objective truth and making sure that what I want to do is done as well as what you might want to do and finding a middle ground between the both of them. I also am a fairly intuitive person and sometimes operate without being able to give facts and figures or sometimes we might not be able to get into the articulation of something and for those situations, I typically say something like Please trust me. It's up to you to whether you want to trust me or not.
      </li>
      <li>
        I also tend to philosophize, spiritualize almost everything that I work on. To me that is not an option but a fundamental nature of how things are and I know no other framework through which I can operate as well as these. And it is not a prerequisite or necessity that you have to engage with me on either of these two levels. It doesn't have to be a philosophy, discussion around philosophy or spirituality, although everything could be that we can also operate on just facts and figures and execution and getting things done. But it would be nice if you gathered the context around the philosophy or spirituality of it such that we have a common shared ontology through which we can operate from.

      <!-- END OF LONGER VERSION -->

      <!--
       So, work for me is a very, very broad category of anything that's serious in its intention.   
       
       Typically, I like to hear the other person's opinions and thoughts about something especially if they agree or disagree. But and we can have a conversation or discussion around it. But that does not mean that what is said by either party is what is going to happen. Because sometimes despite understanding other people's intentions and opinions, we still might want to do what we want to do as long as that is informed and either party is either parties consent is taken. I think we shouldn't be good. 

      There's a certain amount of seriousness and intensity that I bring when I work, which might be off putting some people but that is the only way that I know how to operate. If that is not your brand of whiskey, then that's fine by me but I'm just saying that is who I am

I also try to be as emotionally Cognizant as I am of intellectual cognizance and I think any decisioning working is both an emotional as well as a facts and figures. discussion and I tried to be cognizant of both.

I tend to prefer black and white putting down of things whether that be mind maps, text images, rather than having a femural verbal conversations because those are often forgotten, or recontextualize to the narrative that neither party wants to believe in. I try to approach everything from a place of love and compassion, and I hope that all the work that I put in sort of reflects that fundamental nature of being loving and compassionate towards all sentient and non sentient objects.

Very importantly, I really appreciate honest feedback. If you think an idea of music track or set didn't go well. I would like you to be upfront and tell me about it. I do not like sugarcoating slash convenient conversations for the sake of it. If I have played a cent and I need to adjust after that and you think it wasn't good. I would very much respect if you said that you didn't enjoy it or that you think it wasn't good to and we can have a discussion around why it was so I would want nothing less than I do not want a situation where I have a group of people who echo chamber everything I do and agree to everything that I'm doing just because they are my friends or they don't want to hurt my feelings. I want to be objectively as close to the truth as possible. And for that you need to hear objectivity. So which is also a two way street in the sense of if something is good, I would love it if you can go out of your way and throw in a sentence or two of how you appreciate or like something. But contrary I if you want to play devil's advocate, if you want to push back on something if you think something's not good, if I have rubbed you the wrong way if have left left a bad taste in your mouth, then I would love it if you could tell me that upfront. Because that just makes for a cleaner, nicer conversation. I am at a stage of my life where I cannot hold resentment cannot hold unresolved threads of relationships with people. We might choose to agree to disagree we might choose to not interact with each other or seize our nature of our relationship but that is a better place to be than to leave things open ended and hanging because that causes anxiety causes issues and causes unnecessary amount of mindspace to be taken up.

I love learning I love guidance. I love learning and guidance and thoughts and opinions even from people who might think that they're not qualified. I typically come from a beginner's mindset of having curiosity about everything and because of that, I tend to appreciate whatever anyone is trying to show me and try to learn as much as I can from that. I also try to differentiate between when I'm learning and listening versus when I am contributing. When I'm learning or listening. I tend to take a backseat and not push back because I just want to see where someone's taking me and what perspective they have.

Also, I in future perplexity already apologize if any of my actions feelings, thoughts, hurt or if it is seen as condescension or hurtfulness or making you feel lesser than I sincerely apologize that is almost never my intention. It's just to get to objective truth and making sure that what I want to do is done as well as what you might want to do and finding a middle ground between the both of them. I also am a fairly intuitive person and sometimes operate without being able to give facts and figures or sometimes we might not be able to get into the articulation of something and for those situations, I typically say something like Please trust me. It's up to you to whether you want to trust me or not. And if you want pushback if you want detailing, then that is something that I can do but sometimes it's just a lot easier to trust me and come along and if trusting me has led to a good outcome then that is all the more learning for how trust that is put in me should be taken seriously and thought about with that intention. I also tend to philosophize, spiritualize almost everything that I work on. To me that is not an option but a fundamental nature of how things are and I know no other framework through which I can operate as well as these. And it is not a prerequisite or necessity that you have to engage with me on either of these two levels. It doesn't have to be a philosophy, discussion around philosophy or spirituality, although everything could be that we can also operate on just facts and figures and execution and getting things done. But it would be nice if you gathered the context around the philosophy or spirituality of it such that we have a common shared ontology through which we can operate from.
