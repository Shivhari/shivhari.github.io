                            Adversity brings us closer to each other. The adversity that we face with people around us is important for character building. It makes us more resilient and makes us feel that we can rely on ourselves to ensure our safety and survival.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mt-6">
                            P91 relied on self reliance and it was upto us to ensure that we not only survived but also thrived and raged hard through the entire process. You want X to happen? Congratulations! You are now in charge for X.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mt-6">
                            Facing adversity together with people and knowing that we are part of the same challenges is something that build character and builds comradery. There is a reason why people in the trenches bond so well with each other. Blood of the convent is thicker
                            than water of the womb.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mt-6">
                            I have lost track of the number of things that I did during the festival. Helping others out, helping myself out or making some scene happen. There was always an endless list of things that needed to be done and that you could get yourself involved into.
                            It's a dizzying flurry of activity that is its own drug and its own high. There were certain things that brought about a genuine elation in my mood after it got done.

                        </li>
                        <li class="mt-6">
                            To me the most profound change overall is the immediacy that I feel in my everyday life. Tasks and things to do, no longer seem like a dreaded chore whose responsibility act like weights in my leg. Instead it seems like a call to action. A chance to make
                            a difference and act. A way for me to demonstrate my self reliance.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mt-6">
                            The other profound change is to witness the kindness of others. We often wonder if the world is cold cruel and dark place and we are the only ones who think and care and seem compassionate. However, P91 is such a stark opposite to this. Everyone was being
                            helpful and kind and nice and sweet. There were many times when I started to do something only to be asked by people around me if they could help out as well. People actually helped one another....
                        </li>
                        <li class="mt-6">
                            People were extremely kind and warm and the number of long hugs that I ended up dishing out after being greeted good morning every morning only seemed to increase.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mt-6">
                            The other thing I noticed was an immense propensity to want to help other people. No task was "theirs" and "not mine". If I saw someone do something, I was compelled to help out with it. I felt like it was something I had to contribute in my own way to
                            the best of my abilities. Of course, too many cooks also spoil the broth so some wisdom is needed to figure out where you should help and not.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mt-6">
                            I also think that P91 helped me get closer and live the ideal of a "Karma Yogi". One who attains fulfilment (and maybe even enlightenment) via action and service to others. I might even stick my neck out and say that service to the community and service
                            to others is the only real service, the only real thing that we can offer to the world at large.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mt-6">
                            Until the next burn, I hope that you and I both continue to burn brightly. Seeking our vigour from the fire that was burnt in our hearts and in the man. Until we return back to that fire, let us shine brightly.
